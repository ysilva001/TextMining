Data Science Practicum I

The purpose of this project is to scrap a variety of job sites for data science job postings as part of my Data Science Practicum I project. First, I will use an R package (add package Name) to scrap the web page of a job posting. Then I will work on data transformation including tokenization and text cleanup. Followed by a model to train a model and predict scores for more frequent words. The a classification model to identify grouping terms. Finally, I will visualize my findings and create a web page to showcase my process and findings. 

RapidMine will be used to tokenize the words (a process of breaking a stream of text up into words, phrases, symbols). Using RapidMiner, I will convert the tokens into a matrix (bag of words model).And, once we have a matrix, we can a machine learning algorithm to train a model and predict scores for more frequent words.
