Data Science Practicum I
# Text-Mining

The purpose of this project is to use R to mine and analyze text data to discover interesting patterns and extract useful information. I will analyze patient reviews left on Healthgrades.com for providers with a star rating (1-5).  There will be 5000 providers (1000 for each rating). First, I will import data and load all required packages. Second, I will use the TM package to transform the dataset. I will then banalyze the textual data and will perform predictive modeling to predict the sentiment based on the rating of the provider. Finally, I will visualize my findings and create a web page to showcase my process and findings.
